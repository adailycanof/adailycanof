ðŸ‘‹Hello, I'm Simon Hill. I'm currently working as a DevOps engineer In London for a global macro and digital asset fund. I have been working on migrating and supporting a cloud "lift and shift" move into Amazon Web Services by using automation to build zero-touch environments and remove the human error factor. I look at DevOps more from an infrastructure point of view. 

I'm interested in various topics, so I'm developing various side projects in my spare time.

- Follow the leader: Build a fun application (use the AWS DeepRacer as a digital pet or follow an object) or industrial prototypes (warehousing, manufacturing)
- Custom Alexa Skill- Barn Door Protocol: Turn off all lights and lock all doors at night and vice versa in the morning.
- Achieve all AWS certifications and CKA by the start of 2025.
